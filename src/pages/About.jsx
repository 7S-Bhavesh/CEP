            <p>
              Founded in 2015, Artisan Creations began as a small collective of local artists passionate about bringing handcrafted art into everyday homes. What started as a weekend market stall has grown into a curated online gallery of unique pottery and paintings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each piece in our collection is handcrafted with care, reflecting the unique style and vision of our talented artisans. We believe in the power of art to transform spaces and inspire moments of joy and reflection in daily life.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="section-title">Our Commitment</h2>
            <p>
              We're committed to sustainable practices in our production processes and supporting independent artists. When you purchase from Artisan Creations, you're not just buying a beautiful piece of artâ€”you're supporting a community of creators and a more thoughtful approach to home decor.
